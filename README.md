# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode challenges. I am dedicated to tackling one challenge every working day from the comprehensive roadmap available at [neetcode.io/roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). By adhering to this commitment, I aim to improve my mastery of the C++ language as well as develop a solid understanding of common algorithms and data structures.

## Progress Tracking

You can find a visual representation of my progress in the file [neet_Code progress.png](neet_Code%20progress.png). It provides an overview of the challenges completed so far and those that are yet to be conquered.

## Additional Notes and Information

For more detailed notes and extra information about each challenge, please refer to the Excel sheet [Notes.xlsx](Notes.xlsx). It includes algorithm summaries and indicates whether a particular challenge belongs to the official neetcode roadmap.

In some cases, if I am unable to find a solution within a 30-45 minute time frame, I may consult the neetcode solution and base my contribution on that. This approach ensures that I continue to progress and learn from different problem-solving techniques. However, if a solution appears too good or overly eloquent, it's likely that I have referred to the neetcode solution for inspiration.

## Language and Approach

All the solutions in this repository are implemented using the C++ programming language. I strive to employ efficient algorithms and leverage common data structures to optimize the solutions.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or alternative solutions for the challenges, feel free to contribute! Simply submit a pull request, and I'll be happy to review it.

Join me on this exciting journey as I strengthen my coding skills and explore the fascinating world of problem-solving. Let's enhance our C++ expertise together, one challenge at a time!

## About Me

I am a passionate developer committed to continuous learning and growth.
